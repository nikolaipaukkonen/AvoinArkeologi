Create an app called Harris Matrix Automat that allows archaeologists to generate visual Harris matrices from structured stratigraphical data. The user uploads a CSV file, and the app visualizes the stratigraphical relationships between units in a top-down hierarchical graph, with the newest units on top and the oldest at the bottom.
## Example of the CSV input
unitno,type,above,below
1,deposit,2,0
2,deposit,3;4;7,1
3,structure,2;6,2
4,deposit,5,2
5,deposit,8,4
6,deposit,8,3
7,deposit,8,2
8,deposit,,5;6;7

- The "above" and "below" columns may contain multiple values separated by semicolons (;).
- If the "above" or "below" field is empty, it should be treated as no connection in that direction
- The csv file will contain a header that describes the columns

## Technical constraints
- Single-file app: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be contained in a single index.html file. No external .css or .js files
- The game should be build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Core Technologies: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If needed, you may use a lightweight external library like D3.js for graph visualization
- You will generate your own assets using basic shapes. In the matrix, I want the deposits to be ovals, structures to be rectangles and cuts to be triangles
- The app should be usable on both desktop and mobile devices
- The graph must be top-down, with newer units at the top and older units at the bottom
- Nodes should be spaced automatically to prevent overlap and ensure readability
## Features
- User can input the csv through an upload button
- After the file has been uploaded the user can click "Generate" button to create the Harris matrix image
- The stratigraphical units are connected with lines based on their stratigraphical relationships (above what, below what) as in normal Harris matrix
- The matrix should be interactive so that the user can drag the nodes where they want
- Nodes should be clearly labeled with their unit number.
- The graph should resize dynamically to fit different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).
- Stratigraphic relationships should be visualized with lines connecting nodes (above-below relationships)
- The application includes CSS that makes it look professional and inviting
- The visualization should scale properly for both desktop and mobile devices.


Important: The primary goal is correct interpretation and visualization of the input data. Ensure that the relationships between units are accurately represented in the Harris matrix.
